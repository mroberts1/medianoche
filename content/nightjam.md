<p>Music video for tracks Sleepless City and S'alright created for Scanner's collaborative music project 'NightJam'. The tracks are set to images of the nocturnal city, using photographs produced with the New Horizon Youth Centre in Kingâ€™s Cross. Bleary traffic lights, curtained windows, party people and figures moving across the city are captured against the dark backdrop of the night.</p>

Commissioned by Artangel in 2006  

Filmed by Scanner, Alexandra Gillespie and Somaya Langley  
Edited by Scanner and Alexandra Gillespi
